# Applied-Deep-Learning---Camelyon-16

## Goal

● The goal of this project is to create an automated process for breast cancer detection to assist pathologists.
● The cancer diagnosis is a high clinical relevance task but requires large amounts of reading time from pathologists.
● An automated process to assist pathologists in cancer detection could help to reduce their workload and reduce the subjectivity in diagnosis.
● This project is based on the paper “Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images” from Liu et al.

## Data

● The source data for the project is the CAMELYON16 challenge dataset.

## Code

● The code was divided in 6 books:
